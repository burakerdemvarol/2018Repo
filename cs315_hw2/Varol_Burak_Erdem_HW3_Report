Report Of CS315 - HW2 -

	In python language we can use default parameters decleration. If we use default parameters, one default parameter 
have to follow another default parameters. Otherwise interpreter gives error. Also parameter positions are important
I declared function1 and I tried with different sequences and outputs were different. In python parameter passing was 
hard part for me. Because if I changed list global variable of list changed but normal variables assignment did not change
the global variables. Javascript and PHP has same attributes but only syntax was different.

	In C language no default parameters but C type language which C++ has feature of default parameters decleration.
In C type languages user have to use pointers for change the global variables but sometimes follow the pointers can 
be hard and sometimes side effects occurred. You do not want to change global variables but if you use pointers, 
function can change the global variable.

	I learned these 5 languages parameters passing systems. And it was good practice for coding.
